    <h1 id="section1">Purpose Of This Page</h1>
    <p>I'm experimenting with building a website manually (no bootstrap). 
    I was inspired by <a href="https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Psychic_(type)">Bulbapaedia's website</a>, 
    which is really pretty and aesthetic. It's not as fluid as modern websites, 
    but it makes good use of background colours to present a page that is easy on the eyes.</p>
    <h2>Breakdown Of Model Website</h2>
    <p>
        Bulbapaedia appears to have stayed relatively 'stagnant', unchanged from its early days. 
        I believe that I first chanced upon this gem from 2000 to 2010, where moving elements 
        had not yet become the norm. The overlying theme of this webpage is green and there's a generous use of 
        rounded boxes to contain information. By today's standards, many 
        portions of this website are <strong>information-dense</strong>, which is commendable, especially 
        keeping in mind its purpose as an encyclopaedia. However, its extensive use of images can be 
        rather inconvenient for those with low-speed internet. After all, one of the greatest boons 
        of traditional websites is their high loading speed.
        <br><br>
        Now, with such high information density, one must use alternative ways to break up text into concise prose 
        while <strong>allowing users to distinguish for themselves which they'd rather read</strong>. So if I hear someone 
        calling the bullet-points AI-written, my forehead will soon bear an imprint of my palm.
        <h4>Pros</h4>
            <ol class="list">
                <li><strong>Straightforward, linear navigation.</strong> There are visible (already expanded) 
                    trees and nested navigation links, which provides a clear structure of information.</li>
                <li><strong>Information-dense.</strong> All relevant information is presented 
                    directly, without being abbreviated and shortened into soundbites.</li>
                <li><strong>Lack of design-friction.</strong> Most of the data you could ever want to access 
                    is available in one or two clicks rather than being buried in obscure menus.</li>
                <li><strong>Lack of dancing elements.</strong> I may be in the minority, but 
                    it is disorientating and confusing when elements and words flip around, spin or even 
                    fade into nothingness when scrolling through a website. <a href="https://loops.wannathis.one/">
                    This is a mild example.</a> It took me five seconds to load.</li>
                </ol>
        <h4>Cons</h4>
            <ol class="list">
                <li><strong>Extensive use of images.</strong> Granted, this is an encyclopaedia, so images 
                    may be necessary for a comprehensive and informative guide on the topic at hand. As such, I 
                    don't see this as a true downside. Some have reported that there are too many advertisements, 
                    but I can't comment on that as I use an adblocker.</li>
                </ol>
        </p>
        <!--'a href' stands for a hypertext reference.
        It's supposed to be visible and used for navigation, 
        unlike link rel (for stylesheets)-->
        <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/">What I use as a learning resource.</a>
        <!--An HTML element is defined by a start tag, some content, and an end tag.-->
        <br>
        <div class="image-wrapper"> 
            <img src="mew-icon.png" alt="mew-img">
            <!--This is an image. alt means 'alternative text', whcih appears
            only when the image fails to load.-->
            <!--By using CSS to create a px limit... I can limit the size on mobile.
            It restricts the maximum size but not the minimum size.-->

    <h2>Other Stuff</h2>
    <p>The rest of this page is just filler to make it more fleshed-out. When I see 
        pretty websites like Bulbapaedia, it does fill me with excitement, thinking about 
        designing them. I might be labelled a luddite for disliking many aspects of 
        modern websites, and I do see the benefits of technological progress. An obvious 
        example would be the speed of 5G internet!
