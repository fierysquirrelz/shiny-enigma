    <h1>Purpose Of This Page</h1>
    <p>My first attempt went pretty badly, so I made this as practice and named it 
        'barebones', though it has some colours and customisation.
        <br><br>
        I took a look at some <a href="https://ross-hori.com/blog/why-i-use-static-html-for-my-website.shtml" target="_blank">websites</a> 
        and noticed that they had no sidebars. They weren't super dynamic with disappearing elements and rotating, 
        dancing words, but they were quite sleek and simple. So this style is worth mimicking.
        <br><br>
        This may be 'barebones', but I'm still intent on creating an appealing design, with a navigation 
        bar on top and a footer on the bottom. I aligned the text to the left and centred the container rather than doing it 
        the other way around. The page is the text you're reading, enclosed by the squircle which 
        I have attempted to make less 'ircle' and more 'squ'.   
        <br><br>
        Though I have a slight distaste for excessive dynamicity, like with floating and spinning icons, I am 
        cognizant of its advantages when applied appropriately. The hover function is one such example, where 
        it provides clarity and ease of access to the client to whom the page is being served.
        <br><br>
        This website is not optimised for mobile devices as of <time datetime="2025-04-21">April 21, 2025</time>. 
        Typing this, I was struck with the idea of using the time element, and it excited me. Please check if it works on 
        your end.
        <br><br>
        There's a footer which I'm not sure what to fill with.
        <hr>
        This page is still so empty that I feel compelled to write a little more. Have a look at the parrot on the left, 
        isn't he cute? I went through great pains to not have his tail covered up by the footer, but I was unsuccessful. 
        It was left alone then in fear of breaking the website like I did with my first project. I'd originally 
        intended to shift the page up and place it close to the navigation bar, but this look is quite fitting.
        <br><br>
        The venus flytrap was chosen because its earthly colours suited the page.
        <br><br>
        This process was quite satisfying, although somewhat frustrating, especially when I tried rushing on to the more 
        complex styles. At this time, I will be padding the footer and adding some finishing touches. I'm not sure 
        why there are spaces on the sides of the navigation bar and footer, but I'm done for now.

        the jargon escapes me.</small>
